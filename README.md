## Pipeline
1. Data collection: Tweets, covariates, electoral results, survey results, language demographics
2. Tweet analysis:
	2a. Sentiment analysis: Classifying each Tweet
	2b. Extracting individual-level covariates (gender, age, location, etc.)
3.

## Which countries?
Using several factors, I choose which countries to investigate:
1. Languages spoken: For this project, I limit by research to English-speaking countries
2. Number of Twitter users
2. Electoral corruption
