# Estimating public opinion in developing countries using social media
This project outlines a strategy and its feasibility and limitations in estimating public opinion in English-speaking developing countries. This may have consequences for the idea of political and electoral accountability, the social contract, depending on how our strategy can reliably produce estimates of public opinion. These estimates may serve as a comparison against official electoral results.

## Research design
### How can public Twitter data be used to increase political accountability?

Using Twitter data, I aim to estimate public opinion and investigate to what extent and how these estimates can be used to increase political accountability. 

## Pipeline
1. Data collection: Tweets, covariates, electoral results, survey results, language demographics
2. Tweet analysis:
	* Sentiment analysis: Classifying each Tweet
	* Extracting individual-level covariates (gender, age, location, etc.)
3. Public opinion prediction:
	* Simple favourability proportion (% share who favours a leader over time)
	* Differences by regions, characteristics, events, etc.
	* Rates of change: If overall share is too biased, changes in sentiment may be a better and more reliable predictor
4. Problems
	* Bias of Twitter users: Maybe: Younger, more extreme, more outward-looking, etc. 
	* Bots: How many Tweets does not represent a single person's views? Check research on spotting Twitter bots.

### Get Tweets
`Python`'s [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) module allows us to scrape Tweets in a scalable way. With `R`'s [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package, I call our `Python` function from `R`.

#### Locations within each country
Next focus is being able to gather Tweets from different locations within a country. This can serve to see differences between regions as well as assisting a weighting scheme.
1. Add locations/cities for each country to scraper help data based on what is available in covariate data
2. Scrape tweets for locations in each country

#### Which countries?
Looking at English-speaking proportion, number of Twitter users, electoral corruption and other characteristics, I can select a tentative group of countries: Nigeria, Iraq, Phillipines, Egypt, 

* Which cities or locations to choose should considered in light of the available covariate statistics, e.g. income level, education level, and other demographics, as it should be used for weighting.
* Tweets gathered within the radius of city A may not be in city A's country if it is close to a border

#### Rotating proxies: Robin Hood method:
If Twitter blocks my IP, it may be necessary to automatically change IP proxies throughout the scraping of Tweets. A VPN may help with this as well. Otherwise, a proxy service may be required.
